If users top 100 songs are represented in songs.db counting the average of each energy, valence and danceability of those songs would give us a set
of characteristics we could later name - energy from 0 to 1 where 0 is more laid back and 1 is fast, same with valence (sad to happy) and danceability and
describe aura by that set of named characteristics.

It would not be very representative when listener is listening to both sides of spectrum - that's when average might not be the best case.
Median value could be a better idea?
