# CS50-X-Course
Repository contains my solutions for problem sets and the final project for the CS50's Introduction to Computer Science course from Harvard University.

Key concepts covered in repository's solutions include:
  - *C & Memory Management*: Pointers, memory allocation (malloc/free)
  - *Algorithms & Data Structures*: Implementations of sorting algorithms, searching, linked lists, hastables
  - *Python*: Transition from C to Python language
  - *SQL*: Designing databases and running queries on datasets
  - *Web Development*: Building full-stacks applications, combining HTML, CSS (bootstrap), JavaScript, Flask

Capstone of this course is a web-based music quiz application in project directory

All problem sets can be found on [cs50 website](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/)
